    <center><h4> GANS IN MACHINE LEARNING </h4></center>
    <center>
    Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, 
    are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods,
    such as convolutional neural networks.

    Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning 
    that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a 
    way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from 
    the original dataset.

    GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised 
    learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to 
    generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either 
    real (from the domain) or fake (generated). The two models are trained together in a zero-sum game,
     adversarial, until the discriminator model is fooled about half the time, meaning the generator model is 
     generating plausible examples.

    GANs are an exciting and rapidly changing field, delivering on the promise of 
    generative models in their ability to generate realistic examples across a 
    range of problem domains, most notably in image-to-image translation tasks such as 
    translating photos of summer to winter or day to night, and in 
    generating photorealistic photos of objects, scenes, and people that even humans cannot tell are fake.
